abstract = {{Using the bluffing dice game Dudo as a challenge domain, we abstract information sets by an imperfect recall of actions. Even with such abstraction, the standard Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm proves impractical for Dudo, since the number of recursive visits to the same abstracted information sets increase exponentially with the depth of the game graph. By holding strategies fixed across each training iteration, we show how CFR training iterations may be transformed from an exponential-time recursive algorithm into a polynomial-time dynamic-programming algorithm, making computation of an approximate Nash equilibrium for the full 2-player game of Dudo possible for the first time.}},

Presenting an even simpler variant, I consider the probabilities of the game and present some simple heuristics for play. A simplified version of Perduo is implement and a small number of simple robot players are then built and played against each other and human players and the results presented and discussed. Finally, further research directions and extensions are considered.},

Moreover, the related analysis is presented, with the results of our machine players against human players. The main contribution of our paper is a strategy which involves bluffing. An important goal of this work is the remembrance to John v. Neumann; with our means we pay a tribute to the activity of the "founding father"; on the occasion of his 110 th birthday.},
